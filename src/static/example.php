<?php
include 'globals.php';
include 'header.php';
?>

<p>
This is an example page. You can find these in /static, where you can add .php or .html files. These will be automatically linked in the header navigation. If you want the navigation bar to appear, you must include header.php. Similarly for footer.php etc. By default, you get an empty page, so you have full control.

<?php
include 'footer.php';
