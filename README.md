# get-off-my-lawn - Minimal Web Framework

Have you ever been in hand-to-hand combat with a webpage? Does javascript scare you? Do you still know what a file is, and do you agree that everything is a file? In short, do you miss the good old days of the internet, when webpages could look like sheets of paper, and basically nothing moved? If your answer is a resounding yes on all accounts, then get-off-my-lawn might be for you! Rumored by many to be the new wordpress killer, get-off-my-lawn provides really (like, really) basic blogging functionality, along with an easy way to serve additional user created pages, without the unnecessary bloat that the kids these days cram into all their so-called 'Content Management Systems'.

## Raison d'Être (that's french for "reason to be", you philistine)

I made this because I wanted to have a webpage where I can write text and present my projects and maybe occasionally add a small php script to a static page to do something fun. Naturally, I first tried to use wordpress for this. I had used wordpress many times in the past and I liked it. But when I tried out the latest version it just seemed bloated and overengineered to me. Everything was reactive, WYSIWYG, and customizable, yet I couldn't seem to get basic things done. When I found myself unable to do something as simple as add a header image, I finally broke down. Wordpress wasn't a bad product, but it wasn't for me anymore. I looked at other web frameworks, but they all had similar problems. It was all *too much*. Then, I had an epiphany.

*The internet is just web pages.*

It's true. That's how it all started. Content management systems, Javascript frameworks, bootstrap, angular, Ajax - none of it is necessary. It all started with just machines running apache, serving files. It was enough in the 00s and it's probably enough now. So with what little I know of PHP, HTML, and SQL, I went ahead and told my trusted local AI to whip up some web files that did exactly what I wanted, and nothing more.

And with that. I was free.

This repo exists to serve others who may have similar needs, either to use as a framework, or merely as inspiration to do what I did and taylor something yourself that is specific to your needs. All others - can get off my lawn :)
